#Part 2 of creating Variables of my family member's ages


#Alright, so this time they are telling us to Update Our old variable's Values into new variables 20 years later
#and then print the new variables out, lets do this!


#just in case, your curious about what me and my family age is in 2023, imma put them here just for you

My_Mother_Age = 52
My_Father_Age = 53
My_Sister_Age = 27
My_GrandMother_Age = 81
My_Age = 15

#20 years later.... 2043 (new variables)
My_Mother_Age = 72 #Wow my mom getting older and older, in the future, im gonna be the one taking care of her
My_Father_Age = 73 #Same here, im gonna be the one taking care of him in the future
My_Sister_Age = 47 #Close to her 50s, nice
My_GrandMother_Age = 101 #:Skull: Emoji
My_Age = 35 #im gonna be just a normal ordinary family guy, ending goa with high honors and having programming as a job
#ok enough of joking, lets print all of those to the terminal
print(My_Mother_Age,My_Father_Age,My_Sister_Age,My_GrandMother_Age,My_Age)
